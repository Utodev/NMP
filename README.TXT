This is my very first text adventure game engine. Made in the early 90s, I was learning structured programming when I started and OOP during latest versions. Also, I was learning IBM PC/DOS graphic modes, features, soundblaster, and everything during those years, so to be honest the code is a mixture of everything, and a complete chaos.

Anyway, I'm opening the source code cause, who knows, maybe someone has to compile it again in the future and patch something to make some ancient game made with NMP 5 work in some future OS.

You'll need Borland Pascal 7 to compile this code.
